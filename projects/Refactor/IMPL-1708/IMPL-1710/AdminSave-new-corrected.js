    Revision Notes:
    10/07/2019 - Kendra Austin: Initial creation of the business process.
    05/08/2020 - Kendra Austin: Add ajax save before postback save. Until new form designer, 
                                this is needed to prevent manually set drop-downs from reverting 
                                to the top value. Also added record save confirmation.
    05/24/2022 - Franco Petosa Ayala: function updated to ES6. 
                                      the function DoPostbackSave was removed as it is no longer required.
                                      Inside the function cancelfunction a comment was added for better code understanding.
